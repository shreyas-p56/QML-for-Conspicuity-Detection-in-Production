# Task 4

The goal of this subtask is to develop your own model and use it to learn the sine function on the interval $[0, 2\pi]$. Discretize the interval with a suitable number of points (of your choice) and use the values of the sine function at these discretization points as labels. Implement a Quantum Machine Learning model which reproduces the values of the sine function.
