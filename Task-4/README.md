# Task 4

The goal of this subtask is to develop your own model and use it to learn the sine function on the interval $[0, 2\pi]$. Discretize the interval with a suitable number of points (of your choice) and use the values of the sine function at these discretization points as labels. Implement a Quantum Machine Learning model which reproduces the values of the sine function.

Plan : 

We have to create a quantum model that can approximate the sine function over the given interval. It's similar to using a neural network to approximate and fit a function, but using quantum circuits instead of classical neural networks.

Steps to proceed:
* Discretize the interval: 
Choose a number of points (e.g., 100) in the interval [0, 2π]. Calculate the sine values for these points. These will be your training data.

* Design a quantum circuit:
Create a parameterized quantum circuit that will serve as your model. This circuit should have enough flexibility (i.e., parameterized gates) to approximate the sine function.

* Prepare input encoding:
Decide how to encode the input values (x-coordinates) into quantum states. A common method is angle encoding, where you use the input value to set the angle of a rotation gate.

* Measurement:
Decide how to measure the output of your circuit to get a prediction for sin(x). This could be as simple as measuring the expectation value of a Pauli-Z operator on a specific qubit.

* Define a cost function:
Create a function that calculates the difference between your model's predictions and the true sine values. Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a common choice.

* Optimization:
Use a classical optimization algorithm (e.g., gradient descent) to adjust the parameters of your quantum circuit to minimize the cost function.

* Training:
Run the optimization process on your training data.

* Evaluation:
Test your trained model on new points within the [0, 2π] interval to see how well it approximates the sine function. 
What it means to "learn" the sine function:

Your quantum circuit, after training, should be able to take any input x in [0, 2π] and produce an output that's close to sin(x).
The circuit "learns" in the sense that its parameters are adjusted during training to minimize the difference between its output and the true sine function.

Key concepts:
**Quantum feature maps**: How you encode classical data into quantum states.
Variational quantum circuits: Parameterized circuits that can be optimized.
Hybrid quantum-classical optimization: Using classical optimizers to tune quantum circuits.

Remember, the goal is not to calculate the sine function (which quantum computers aren't particularly good at) but to demonstrate that a quantum circuit can be trained to approximate a known function, showcasing the potential of quantum machine learning
